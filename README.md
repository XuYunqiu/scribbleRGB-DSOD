# Scribble RGB-D SOD
Dataset, code and result repository for our paper:

Weakly Supervised RGB-D Salient Object Detection with Prediction Consistency Training and Active Scribble Boosting, TIP'22

![alt text](./teaser.jpeg) 


## Scribble datasets (NJU2K-S & NLPR-S)
We manually re-labeled two widely used publicly available RGB-D SOD benchmarks (*i.e.*, NJU2K and NLPR) with scribble annotattions.
Please find the scribble datasets from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U5-n3oLWLHqePE--ivKywnjqdJNgGZJq).

## Code and pre-trained models
Coming soon.

## Results
Coming soon.
